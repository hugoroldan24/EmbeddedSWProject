# Wireless Dual-Servo Controller

An embedded project that uses two ATMega328P microcontrollers and nRF24L01 RF modules to drive two hobby servos from an analog joystick remotely. Through this project Iâ€™m deepening my skills in:

- **Low-level C & register programming** on AVR  
- **SPI & ADC setup** for efficient data exchange and analog sampling  
- **Interrupt-driven data flow** to guarantee real-time responsiveness  
- **Timer-based PWM generation** at 50 Hz for accurate servo control  
- **RF link configuration** and power-up sequencing per nRF24L01 datasheet  
- **Datasheet interpretation**, extracting register settings and timing constraints

- **AVR-GCC toolchain** (avr-gcc + avr-libc)  
- **Makefile** for build/flash automation  
- **SPI**, **ADC**, **Timer1**, **Timer0**, and **External Interrupt** drivers

## ðŸš€ Work Flow

**1. Read Joystick Inputs**
     The transmitter MCU samples the two analog axes of the joystick via its ADC and converts those readings into digital values.

**2. Send Data to RF Module**
     The MCU packages the joystick values into a data packet and transfers it over SPI to the nRF24L01+ configured as a transmitter.

**3. Transmit Over the Air**
     The nRF24L01+ radio module sends the packet wirelessly to the paired receiver module.

**4. Receive and Forward Data**
     The nRF24L01+ receiver module captures the incoming packet and relays it over SPI to the receiver MCU.

**5. Generate PWM for Servos**
     The receiver MCU reads the joystick values, maps them to appropriate register settings, and drives two PWM outputsâ€”one for each servo motorâ€”to control speed and direction.
